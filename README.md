## Projects

### 1. [**Airbnb Data Engineering Project**](https://github.com/Sheik1sha/airbnb-dbt-snowflake)
Built an **end-to-end modern data engineering pipeline** using **AWS S3, Snowflake, dbt, Dagster, and Power BI** to transform raw Airbnb data into analytics-ready datasets and business insights.

**Highlights**  
- Ingested raw Airbnb CSV files from **AWS S3 into Snowflake** using **External Stage + COPY INTO / Snowpipe**  
- Built **staging and core dimensional models** using **dbt**  
- Implemented an **incremental fact table (`fct_reviews`)** with surrogate keys and date-based filtering  
- Enforced **data quality using dbt tests**: unique, not_null, relationships, accepted_values, positive_values  
- Orchestrated and monitored transformations using **Dagster**  
- Designed **Power BI dashboards** for host performance, pricing analysis, sentiment trends, and review behavior  

📊 *Tech Stack:* AWS S3 · Snowflake · dbt · Dagster · Power BI · SQL · Git · GitHub  


### 2. [**Brazilian E-Commerce Data Engineering Project**](https://github.com/Sheik1sha/Project-Brazillian-Ecommerce)
Built an **end-to-end Azure data pipeline** for the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) integrating **Azure Data Factory, Databricks (PySpark), Synapse Analytics, and Power BI/Tableau**.  

**Highlights**  
- Automated ingestion from GitHub JSON + SQL using Azure Data Factory  
- Data cleaning and transformation in Azure Databricks using PySpark  
- Modeled curated Gold-layer tables in Azure Synapse  
- Built Tableau dashboards showing sales trends, delivery delays, payment mix, and top categories  
- Implemented Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture with incremental refresh logic  

📊 *Tech Stack:* Azure Data Factory · Databricks · PySpark · Synapse Analytics · Power BI · Tableau · Data Lake Storage Gen2  

### 3 <a href="https://github.com/Sheik1sha/2023-Technical-Support-and-KPI-Analysis-">**Technical Support Analytics: Enhancing Service Efficiency and Customer Satisfaction**

Analyzed customer support data to uncover trends in ticket distribution, agent performance, SLA compliance, and customer satisfaction. Focused on delivering actionable insights to optimize support operations, reduce SLA violations, and enhance the customer experience. Utilized Tableau for interactive visualizations and Python for data preprocessing.

### 4 <a href="https://github.com/Sheik1sha/Insurance-Policy-Analytics">**Insurance Policy Analytics: Visualizing Trends, Risks, and Opportunities**
   
Explored insurance policy records to uncover patterns in premiums, claims, risk factors, and regional performance. Delivered insights that optimized policy pricing, risk assessment, and resource allocation, enhancing decision-making in the insurance industry. Leveraged Power BI for visualization and Python for data preparation.

### 5 <a href="https://github.com/Sheik1sha/Optimizing-User-Engagement-">**Optimizing User Engagement: A/B Testing Website Background Color**</a>

Conducted A/B testing to analyze the impact of website background color (White vs. Black) on user engagement metrics such as page views, time spent, and conversion rates. Identified that the Black background significantly improved conversion rates without affecting browsing behavior. Provided actionable recommendations to implement the Black background site-wide and optimize for high-performing segments like desktop users and regions like England. Utilized Python for statistical analysis and data visualization.
